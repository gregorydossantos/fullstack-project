# About project

Fullstack Project is a full stack web application built to manage an appointment system in a barber shop. Using the resources of the application customers will be able to schedule times and make changes to this schedule by placing it at another time or even date. The backend will use an api rest that will communicate with the database, based on the basic functions of the crud model.
